The example files here are for some photographs that I've posted on my website.

Again, NOTE that the referral to the Vanilla CSS file in the "project"_vfront.txt must be changed to reflect the location of the CSS file you intend to use in production.


TO RUN THE EXAMPLE,

Copy all these files into a work directory.

Enter:

perl makeweb.pl test


When done, the output file "test_vtest.html" should be present.
