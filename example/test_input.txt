Party Boat
Taken in the harbor at Bali. This "pirate ship" was cruising around the harbor while the party people drank, danced, and made a LOT of noise. This photo was taken from our cabin balcony, using the GX85. The 5-axis movement compensation made it easy to get a clear photo. You can see the individual partiers with no problem.

Hong Kong
The buildings were lit up this visit, much as in the past. However, now, they use vast numbers of LED's. In the past it was neon. The building here has the time displayed over the surface of the entire building. Taken with the GX85.

Honolulu Skyline at Sunrise
It was still night as we entered Honolulu harbor. You can see a nice skyline of highrise buildings in the dark. Unfortunately, I was unable to get a good view of Diamond Head as we entered, there are just too many buildings now. Again, taken with the Panasonic Lumix GX85.

Luna Park, Sydney, Australia
Taken with the Nikon D700, while entering Sydney Harbour. The harbor entrance is one of the finest in the world. This is the amusement park right at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
