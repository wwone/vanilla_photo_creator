The information with the Perl script discusses most documentation issues.

Note that the "vfront" and "vback" example files have been created with an example project. FILL IN what is unique for you.

The "input" file has a unique format, and requires some explanation:

It is a text file.

For each image, you need 4 text lines:

1) primary image caption (wll be shown in boldface)

2) secondary image caption -- this is usually the same text for all photos in a project, but you are free to use whatever text you wish. Will be connected to the primary text, and will NOT be in boldface

3) exact URL for the thumbnail image. These images are shown inline with the captions. They are usually smaller than the presentation image, I used images that are 500 pixels across

4) exact URL for the presentation image. These images will be displayed by themselves when the thumbnail image is clicked. Whatever size you want.

Errors in formatting for these "input" entries will not be handled very well. KEEP TRACK of your 4-line entries...
